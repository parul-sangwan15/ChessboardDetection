# Project Description: Chessboard Detection using OpenCV

## Goal
Develop a computer vision system to automatically analyze games of draughts (checkers), streamlining gaming experiences and eliminating manual recording processes.

## Technique
Utilize the OpenCV library in C++ to implement image processing techniques, including corner detection and pattern recognition, to accurately detect the board and identify the positions of checkers.

## Insights
Gain insights into various aspects of computer vision, such as image processing challenges, perspective transformation, and object detection. Explore potential gaming and automation applications of computer vision technologies.
